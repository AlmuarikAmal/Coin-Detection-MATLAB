# Coin-Detection-MATLAB
The code perform the operations as follow: 
- Reads an input image ('coins.png') and converts it to grayscale if it's not already.
- Converts the grayscale image to a binary image.
- Fills any holes in the binary image.
- Computes properties (area and centroid) of connected components in the binary image.
- Displays the original image with detected coins and their type (dimes or nickels).
- Counts and displays the number of dimes and nickels detected.

Overall, it aims to process an image of coins, detect different coin types based on area, and count the number of dimes and nickels in the image.
